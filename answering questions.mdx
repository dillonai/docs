## Best Practices (Prompt Recommendations)

To get the best results from Consulter AI, it’s essential to answer John’s questions thoughtfully. John asks questions to understand your needs, project goals, and desired outcomes, and how you respond directly shapes the quality of insights you receive. Here’s a guide to making the most of each question John asks.

### Initial Questions: Setting Up Your Project

#### 1. **Hey, how’s it going? What kind of problems can I help you with?**

This question is about defining the focus of your project. Instead of a general response like “I need strategy help,” aim to be specific. For example, if you need insights on sustainable packaging trends, say, “I’m looking for consumer insights on sustainable packaging trends in North America.” This clarity helps John pull the most relevant insights for your needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="target" title="Define Your Problem Clearly">
    Think about the specific outcome you want. If it’s a report on trends, mention the market or audience. If it’s competitive analysis, name the competitors or industry.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 2. **What would you like to name this project?**

Project names help keep your work organized and provide context to your team if you’re collaborating. A good project name should reflect the project’s goals in a few words. For example, “2024 Market Analysis – Sustainable Packaging” is much more informative than “Market Analysis.”

    Including the year and focus area in the project name helps make it easy to recognize and locate later.

#### 3. **What is the name of your company/business?**

Providing your company’s name allows John to customize insights to your industry, company culture, or positioning in the market. This detail also helps ensure your data remains securely tied to your brand.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Provide Specific Brand or Division">
    Use the exact name or division relevant to the project, especially if the project has a specific focus within a larger organization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 4. **Do you want to use the Consulter AI database, your own data, your pre-written content, or a mix of both?**

Consulter AI’s extensive database includes a variety of industry insights, but sometimes blending this with your proprietary data provides a richer perspective. If you have specialized data or previous research, choosing a mix can give John a deeper context to draw from.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Choose Data Sources Based on Needs">
    For a broad overview, Consulter AI’s database alone may be enough. For detailed insights specific to your brand or project, include your own data or pre-written content.
  </Accordion>

### Personalization Questions: Understanding Goals and Context

To fine-tune the presentation, John will ask seven additional questions about your goals and context. Thoughtful responses here will lead to a more personalized, relevant, and impactful presentation.

#### 1. **What’s the primary goal of your presentation (e.g., inform, persuade, inspire) and who is your target audience?**

This question helps align the presentation style with your objectives. For instance, if the goal is to persuade a board of directors, John can prioritize data-driven arguments and clear visuals. If the target is a customer-facing team, the presentation might emphasize simplicity and actionable insights.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bullseye" title="Define Goal and Audience">
    Describe the presentation’s main purpose and who it’s intended to reach. This helps John tailor the tone, content depth, and style.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 2. **Are there any key issues you want to address or specific outcomes you hope to achieve?**

Mentioning specific issues or desired outcomes provides a focal point for the analysis. For example, if you’re trying to address a gap in the market, John will emphasize opportunities and competitive positioning.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="flag" title="Identify Key Issues and Goals">
    Clearly state any specific challenges or goals to help John prioritize relevant insights that support these objectives.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 3. **Could you describe any recent successes or challenges related to your project?**

Including recent successes or challenges adds valuable context. For example, if you’ve recently succeeded in launching a product, John can highlight strategies that build on this success.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="trophy" title="Share Context on Successes or Challenges">
    Providing this background allows John to build upon recent wins or address pain points directly in the insights provided.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 4. **Are there relevant industry trends or competitor actions to consider?**

Relevant industry trends or competitor actions help keep the insights timely and focused on your competitive landscape. For instance, if competitors are leaning toward sustainable practices, John can emphasize similar strategies or differentiate your approach.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Mention Industry Trends and Competitors">
    Including trends or competitor actions ensures that the insights are both relevant and forward-looking, considering the evolving market context.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 5. **Any important perspectives, quotes, or data points you want me to take into account?**

If you have specific quotes, data points, or unique perspectives, sharing them can make the presentation feel more authentic and aligned with your message. For instance, a customer testimonial can reinforce credibility.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="quote-right" title="Include Key Data or Quotes">
    Adding quotes or unique data points provides John with additional material to emphasize your core message and values.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 6. **What unique selling points or value propositions should we emphasize?**

Your unique selling points (USPs) set you apart from competitors. Mentioning these allows John to highlight aspects that differentiate your product, service, or brand in the market.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="star" title="Highlight Unique Selling Points">
    Clearly define your key value propositions so John can focus on showcasing what makes your company or offering distinct.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### 7. **Should this deck include any specific pricing information or should we not mention pricing?**

Pricing information can be sensitive depending on your goals. Letting John know whether or not to include it ensures the presentation aligns with your approach, whether it’s sales-driven or purely informative.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Clarify Pricing Information Needs">
    If pricing should be included, mention any specific details or pricing structures. If not, let John know to avoid any reference to costs.
  </Accordion>
