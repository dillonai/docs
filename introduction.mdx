## 3. Getting Started: Dashboard

Once logged in, you’ll be directed to the Consulter AI dashboard, your central hub for all activity. Here, you’ll see tabs such as **Recent**, **My Projects**, **Recommended**, and **Shared With Me**, allowing you to navigate through current and past projects with ease. The dashboard is organized to help you quickly locate the information you need, start new projects, and explore recommendations tailored specifically to your objectives.

## 4. Creating a New Project

To begin a new project, click on the “Create a New Project” button on the dashboard. Consulter AI will guide you through setting up project parameters, including objectives, timelines, and areas of focus. From there, John, your AI consultant, will take over, processing your inputs to provide highly relevant insights and strategy recommendations. The process is designed to be intuitive, ensuring you can create and set up projects without the need for any technical expertise.

## 5. How It Works

Consulter AI combines the power of advanced algorithms and consulting expertise to deliver actionable insights within minutes. Once you start a project, the AI scans and processes relevant data sources, generating insights aligned with your specific needs. Over time, John learns from your preferences, refining his responses to better suit your strategic objectives. This adaptive process ensures that every report and recommendation becomes more attuned to your unique requirements.

## 6. Security, My Data, & Privacy

At Consulter AI, the security and privacy of your data are paramount. All data is stored in encrypted formats, complying with the highest standards of data protection.

Additionally, your data is solely used to improve the relevance and quality of your consulting insights and is never shared with third parties.

To enhance project analysis, Consulter AI allows you to upload files directly in the project workspace. For now, please drag and drop your file into the specified area within your project settings. Accepted formats include PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX. Soon, we’ll be expanding functionality to include additional formats and larger file sizes. Uploading documents provides John with critical context, allowing for more precise and tailored recommendations.

## 8. How can I upload my brand template?

For consistency with your corporate identity, you can incorporate your brand template into Consulter AI’s outputs. At this stage, please email your brand template to our support team, and we’ll ensure it’s applied to your reports. We accept files in formats like PPTX, DOCX, and PDF for brand assets.
